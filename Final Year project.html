        <strong>Project Name:</strong><p> Characterization of Brake Pad Composite Materials by Varying the Composition 
            of Epoxy and Natural Fibres </p><br>
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> <p align="justify">The application of composite materials to brake pads is becoming increasingly popular 
                with their remarkable performance properties, including thermal stability, wear resistance, and 
                noise reduction. Nevertheless, research is still working on improving new composite materials to 
                achieve even better performance. In this research, composites were developed through the hand 
                layup process with epoxy resin used as the matrix with Sugarcane Bagasse, Pineapple Fiber, and 
                Glass Fiber as reinforcement. The amount of the composites was manipulated by changing the 
                reinforcing material percentages. Different tests were performed such as Tensile, Flexural Strength, 
                and Impact Tests. The test results showed that reinforcement materials incorporation in the epoxy 
                resin matrix increased the mechanical characteristics of the composites. The general observation of 
                this study is that the hand layup process is a good approach to fabricating brake pad composite 
                materials, and adding rice husk, hemp, sugarcane, and pineapple fibers can enhance further these 
                characteristics. The sample specimen containing a blend of 50 weight percent, 25 weight percent, 
                15 weight percent, and 15 weight percent yielded the best results. Since it encourages innovation, 
                ensures sustainability, and minimizes emissions in the automotive industry, this research aligns with 
                the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p>
